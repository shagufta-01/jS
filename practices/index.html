    Memoization in JavaScript is a technique used to optimize the performance of functions by storing the results of expensive 
    function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This approach can significantly improve the
     performance of applications that repeat function calls with the same parameters.

    Here are the key concepts and ways to implement memoization in JavaScript:
    
    What is memoization?: Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of function calls in a cache, and retrieves 
    the results from the cache when the same inputs occur again.
    How does memoization work?: Memoization works by storing the
     previous results of a function call and using those results the next time the function runs. This can be especially useful 
     in computation-heavy apps that repeat function calls on the same parameters.
    When to use memoization?: Memoization is useful when:
    You have a function that is called multiple times with the same parameters.
    The function performs expensive computations that can be cached.
    You want to speed up the performance of your application.
    How to implement memoization?: To implement memoization, you can use a cache object to store the 
    results of function calls. When the function is called, it checks whether the result is present in the cache 
    before running. If it is, it returns the cached results. Otherwise, it executes the function and stores the result in the cache.
